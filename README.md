## Getting Started

Welcome to GetX MVP, a Flutter project designed with clean architecture principles and utilizing GetX for state management and network calls.

## Introduction

GetX MVP serves as a foundation for building scalable and maintainable Flutter applications. It incorporates the following key principles and technologies:

- **Clean Architecture**: The project structure adheres to clean architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers such as presentation, domain, and data. This promotes code maintainability, testability, and flexibility.
  
- **State Management with GetX**: GetX is utilized for state management, offering a lightweight and intuitive solution for managing application state, navigation, dependencies, and more. By leveraging GetX, we ensure efficient and reactive state management throughout the application.

- **Network Calls**: The project includes a dedicated service for handling network calls. This service provides a centralized mechanism for making API requests, processing responses, and managing errors. By encapsulating network logic within a service, we achieve better separation of concerns and facilitate easier testing and maintenance.
